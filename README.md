# P2P File Sharing App 

 **Objective**: Build a high-performance, scalable, command-line peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing application in C++17 on Linux. The app will use **TCP/IP socket communication** and **POSIX multithreading**, with performance tuning for **200+ concurrent peers**.

## Tech Stack

* **Language**: C++17
* **Networking**: POSIX TCP/IP sockets
* **Concurrency**: POSIX threads (pthreads)
* **Testing**: GTest
* **Build System**: CMake
* **Debugging**: GDB
